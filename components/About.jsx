          <p>
          I worked 11 years as a Philosophy teacher, in various educational institutions and university academy research. There I learn a lot about soft skills, teamwork, leadership, and being analytical, but, I feel something is missing.
          </p>

          <p>
          Since I was a child I have played video games and have had an interest in computers, but only in the past years did I take the time to learn about programming, and I was fascinated, by the logic, and the creating aspect, I was thrilled with this kind of knowledge, so I decided to become a developer.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
          First I studied some apps and free websites, but later I went to a boot camp, where I gained experience with some technologies and started to make some projects, after that, I read, and practiced with other frameworks and possibilities to become a great web developer
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
          Now I work as a Full Stack Web Developer with more than a year of experience, doing projects with multiple frameworks, tools, and technologies. You can see some in my projects section.
